<font size=+2>EMULATOR</font><br>
<font size=+1>Most Recent Release</font><br>
<a href=Poly_emulator_bin_v12.zip>Poly and Proteus Emulator 1.2 (for Windows)</a><br>
Now contains ROM version 3.4 and fixes for the 6840 and interrupts (but, unfortunately, still oncasionally hangs)<br>
<br>
<font size=+1>Old Versons</font><br>
<a href=Poly_emulator_bin_v11.zip>Poly and Proteus Emulator 1.1 (for Windows)</a><br>
Now emulates the Poly, Proteus, and Epson MX-80 Printer.<br>
<br>

<a href=Poly_emulator_bin_v10.zip>Poly and Proteus Emulator 1.0 (for Windows)</a><br>
This emulator is a completely refactored emulator that does the Poly and the Proteus. 
It emulates the dual processor of the Proteus (6809 and Z80), and the networking between the Proteus and the Poly.
You can boot POLYSYS, FLEX and CP/M disks.  There are some "features" it does not emulate fully, but these
are unlikely to be seen (such as display top-half of screen double-height).  Let me know if you want
the source code.<br>
<br>

<a href=PolyEmulator.zip>Poly Emulator 0.11 (for Windows)</a><br>
This is a proof-of-concept emulator that demonstrates that yes, with an enormous amount of
effort it is, indeed, possible to write and emulator for the Poly.  It took quite some time
to de-code the ROM, to decode the hardware.  It works on Windows.  It fully supports
Text and Graphics (pages 1,2,3,4, and 5, including mixed modes), Sound, Clock, and Cassette Interface.
It does not yet support networking.<br>

<font size=+2>Poly Disk Archive</font><br>
<a href=disks/software.htm>Poly Software Archive</a><br>
The Poly were connected to a drive unit that housed dual 8" floppy disks.  Single sided they held 295,680 bytes and
double sided they held 591,360 bytes.  We connected a dual-floppy NEC APC to the PC via the serial port and wrote CP/M
software in 8088 machine code to dump the disks and send them to the PC.  The Poly disks were formatted 77 tracks, 15 sectors per 
side, 256 bytes per sector.  Sector skewing was used and the sector order was:01,06,0B,04,09,0E,02,07,0C,05,0A,0F,03,08,0D,17,1C,10,
15,1A,13,18,1D,11,16,1B,14,19,1E,12.<br>

Before the 6809 Poly, Neil Scott (and a Mark Wilson) taught a course at the Wellington Polytechnic that was attended by John Murphy who still
has the "WP POLYWOG 6802" we built as part of that course.<br>

<A href=poly_password_cracker.c>Poly Password Cracker</a><br>
POLYSYS allows the user to password protect a file.  When a user logs on it askes for the
user's initials and password.  Each of these is encrypted into a single byte (one for initials one for password)
these are then stored in the directory entry of the file (in "reserved" locations).  The encryption
algorithm is explicit in prot.cmd.  Given the encrypted bytes this program generates an "initials" and a "password"
that can be used to access the files.

The Poly's design name was Polywog.  This is an internal design document that describes the graphics,

<font size=+1>Disks</font><br>
<a href=PolyNetSys.dsk>Poly Network Boot Disk</a><br>
A Poly network boot disk.  It has the Poly and the Drive unit verisons of FLEX.  For some reason
the login program does not exist on this disk, it is a dump of an original from PolyCorp.<br>
<br>
<a href=PolyPascal.dsk>Parts of Pascal Disk</a><br>
This is a user's work disk with parts of the Poly Pascal compiler on it.  At present I can't
read the entire Poly Pascal distribution disk so expect this to be replaced in due course.<br>
<br>





<font size=+1>Dissassembley</font><br>
<a href=plrt16v3e9.bin>Poly-1 BIOS</a><br>
This is the Poly BIOS.  It was stored "encrypted" in the ROMS. This is the decrypted version.<br>
<br>
<a href=polybios.6809.asm>Poly-1 BIOS Dissassembly</a><br>
Commented dissassembly of the Poly-1 BIOS.  The commenting is not complete (and not always
accurate).  In order to build the emulator it was necessary to dissassemble the BIOS in order
to work out what it did and where in the address space the peripherals were located.  This
should serve to answer some questions about the hardware.  Many websites detailing the 
Poly hardware are wrong.<br>
<br>
<a href=bootsector.bin>Poly Disk Boot Sector</a><br>
This is the boot-sector from a poly disk.  It's a straight binary dump<br>
<br>
<a href=bootsector.6809.asm>Poly Disk Boot Sector Dissassembly</a><br>
So what, exactly, was the architecture of the Poly Disk Unit?  It was a 6809
with a WD controler located at E014-E01B.  The poly ran an adapted verison of FLEX on 
the disk unit.  The Poly boot sector was almost identical to the SWTPc boot sector
given in the FLEX manuals.<br>
<br>
<a href=polysys.6809.asm>Poly FLEX Dissassembley (for the Poly-1)</a><br>
This is the part of FLEX that ran on the Poly-1 unit itself.  The communications with the server
is via the FLEX FCB mechanism, the Poly replaces the FCB next-file chain with the serial number
of the Poly, transmits it down the network and waits for a reply.
The commenting is incomplete and not always correct.<br>
<br>
<a href=polynet.6809.asm>Poly FLEX Dissassembley (for the Network Drive Unit)</a><br>
This part of FLEX ran on the PROTEUS (and presumably the POLYDRIVE) disk unit.  It recieves
FCB commands from the network, services then and transmits the results back down the network.
The commenting is incomplete and not always correct.<br>
<br>
<a href=prot_23.6809.asm>Poly FLEX PROT command</a><br>
This was disassembled in order to understand how the username, password, and file protection
code worked.  It appears to use "reserved" FCB fields and "reserved" system calls to do it.
This is probably why there were reserved.<br>
